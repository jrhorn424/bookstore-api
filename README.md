# bookstore-api

Coding along with [Frank Treacy](https://github.com/frank06). Frank is awesome for many reasons, but especially because he's committed to keeping his Ember tutorials up-to-date. Check them out at [Ember Igniter](http://emberigniter.com).

This API is built primarily by following along with [Building a modern bridge between Ember 2.0 and Rails 5 with JSON API](http://emberigniter.com/modern-bridge-ember-and-rails-5-with-json-api/), with a little bit more from [Building a UI Around an Ember 2.0 Data App](http://emberigniter.com/building-user-interface-around-ember-data-app/).

## Installation

Clone this repository.

Get your own copies of [edge Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) and [edge ActiveModelSerializers](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers). See the `Gemfile` if you're not sure where to save them.

Install dependencies with `bundle install`.

Run the API server with `bin/rails server` or `bundle exec rails server`.
